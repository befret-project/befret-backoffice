# Firebase Database Investigation Report

## Summary
The issue where the befret-backoffice was finding 0 documents in the 'parcel' collection has been **RESOLVED**. The root cause was a **configuration mismatch** between the backoffice and the actual Firebase project containing the data.

## Problem Description
- The backoffice was successfully connecting to Firebase but finding 0 documents in the 'parcel' collection
- The befret_new Angular application was working correctly and presumably had access to parcel data
- This created confusion about whether the database actually contained data

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Environment Configuration Mismatch
The backoffice `.env.local` file was configured with **demo/mock Firebase settings**:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=demo-project
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=demo.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=demo-api-key
```

### Issue 2: Different Firebase Projects
While the befret_new Angular app was correctly connecting to the **real befret-development Firebase project**:
```env
projectId: 'befret-development'
apiKey: 'AIzaSyDgU_qyND7LXCY-hESIzUvu8jIqFflc_BE'
authDomain: 'befret-development.firebaseapp.com'
```

## Investigation Process

### 1. Firebase Project Verification
- Verified that the befret-development Firebase project exists and is accessible
- Confirmed there are **3 databases** in the project: (default), beacceptstore, beprodstore
- Tested Firebase CLI access and permissions

### 2. Database Content Verification
Created and ran scripts to directly query the befret-development Firebase project, which revealed:
- **422 total parcels** in the 'parcel' collection
- Status distribution:
  - draft: 308
  - delivered: 25 
  - received: 30
  - pending: 38
  - arrived: 4
  - sent: 8
  - invalid: 8
  - unknown: 1

### 3. Configuration Analysis
Compared Firebase configurations between:
- befret_new (Angular): ✅ Correctly configured for befret-development
- befret-backoffice: ❌ Using demo/mock configuration

## Resolution

### Fixed Configuration
Updated `/home/yannick/projets/befret-backoffice/.env.local` with the correct befret-development project settings:

```env
# Firebase Configuration (Real befret-development project)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyDgU_qyND7LXCY-hESIzUvu8jIqFflc_BE
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=befret-development.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=befret-development
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=befret-development.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=384879116689
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:384879116689:web:d0e89a006a3111eec2da30
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-KYB5JZJNMG

# Firebase Admin Development  
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=befret-development
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=befret-backoffice-admin-dev@befret-development.iam.gserviceaccount.com
# ... (service account credentials)
```

### Verification
Post-fix testing confirmed:
- ✅ Backoffice can now connect to befret-development project
- ✅ Successfully queries the 'parcel' collection
- ✅ Finds multiple documents (422 parcels total)
- ✅ Can access real parcel data with proper tracking IDs, statuses, etc.

## Key Findings

### Database Content Analysis
The befret-development database contains **real user data**, not just test data:
- Real user names and tracking IDs
- Multiple parcel statuses (draft, delivered, received, etc.)  
- Created dates spanning from 2024 to 2025
- Various parcel types (Paquet, Courrier)

### Authentication & Permissions
- Firebase security rules require authentication: `isAuthenticated()` and user ownership
- Service account has proper permissions for admin access
- No permission issues once connected to correct project

### Multiple Environments
The project has multiple environment configurations:
- `.env.local` (local development) - was using demo settings
- `.env.development` (development) - has correct settings
- `.env.production` (production) - has correct settings
- `.env.staging` (staging) - has correct settings

## Recommendations

### 1. Environment Configuration Best Practices
- Always verify `.env.local` matches the intended environment
- Consider using environment-specific naming (e.g., `.env.local.real` vs `.env.local.demo`)
- Add validation in application startup to verify correct project connection

### 2. Data Verification Scripts
- Keep database verification scripts for troubleshooting
- Create automated tests to verify Firebase connection configuration
- Add environment validation in CI/CD pipeline

### 3. Documentation
- Document which Firebase project each environment should use
- Maintain clear configuration examples for each environment
- Add troubleshooting guide for Firebase connection issues

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - The backoffice now correctly connects to the befret-development Firebase project and can access all 422 parcels in the database.
